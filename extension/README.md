## Notes

The DX of developing a Chrome extensions pales in comparison to that of a
framework like Next.js. And while Plasmo is a huge step forward, it's – by its own
admission – alpha software.

Because of this, I'm deliberately keeping business logic minimal in the extension.

### Tailwind v4

Currently not worth upgrading. [Their Tailwind example](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-tailwindcss)
doesn't include it, and there's [a known issue](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/plasmo/issues/1188) with upgrading.
