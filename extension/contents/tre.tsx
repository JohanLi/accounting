/*
  Their invoices aren't static but generated based on the latest "template".
  Some time after the summer of 2023, a major change to that template occurred.

  Before, the invoices themselves were extremely invasive: you got a detailed
  log of all the numbers you called, when you called, and how long each
  call lasted along with whom you messaged. You could also see a daily
  breakdown of data usage. It makes even less sense when you consider the
  fact that my phone plan is unlimited â€“ none of that information is relevant
  for billing purposes.

  It's all gone now, thankfully.
