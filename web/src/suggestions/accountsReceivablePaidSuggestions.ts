/*
  Possible feature enhancement: is there a need to visually link
  an accounts receivable entry to the entry that paid it?

  I think having something more explicit that signals if an accounts receivable
  has been paid will make this logic clearer. Otherwise, you have to look at
  all entries involving accounts receivables to figure that out.

  For now, we'll look at entries created midway through the previous and
  midway before the current fiscal year. This approach works as long as
  there aren't invoices that are paid after a massive delay.
