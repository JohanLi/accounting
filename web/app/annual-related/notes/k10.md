# Submitting K10-blanketten

K10 (Kvalificerade andelar i fåmansföretag) is something I need to submit every year. It is not for my AB, but
for me as a private person since I own that AB.

## Allmänna uppgifter

- Choose "huvudregel"
- Antal ägda andelar – 500
- Antal andelar förvärvade - 0

## Huvudregeln

- Omkostnadsbelopp vid årets ingång
  - This is 25000 \* 10,94%. Pre-2010, you needed 100k to start an AB, but it was lowered to 50k. 2020 onwards, it was lowered even further to 25k.
- Lönebaserat utrymme section – fill in my salary in all 3 required fields (because I'm the only employee)
  - This section lets you verify if you qualify for huvudregeln

Done!

### General observations

Most, if not all, of the information you need to fill in feels like information that Skatteverket already has.

I understand that they need to create a general solution that fits everyone, and it'd be too
costly to improve the UX. But I would have liked a user journey that was more like this: similar
to filling time reports, instead of needing to specify which dates you worked, you just need to
specify sick days/vacation days. In other words, have a journey where you only specify
deviations from the previous year. Ownership and omkostnadsbelopp are unlikely to change,
but "Lönebaserat utrymme" might see smaller changes for each year (due to brytpunkt for statlig skatt).

K10-blanketten is another example of something that involves data from a long time span –
I'm submitting it in 2024, based on dividends I received in 2023. The way the dividends are
taxed (utdelningsutrymme) is based on my salary in 2022.

### Creating an importable file

It's not well-documented how you can accomplish this, but below is a starting point:
