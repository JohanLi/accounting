#### Third-party services for submitting annual reports

Interestingly, the two services I've tried both calculated a different
"Skatt på årets resultat". As far as I can tell, it's because one of them
doesn't properly handle accounting entries that should not affect the tax
(either positively or negatively).

Unsurprisingly, it's the cheaper and less used one (looking at revenue numbers)
that doesn't handle it correctly. You get what you pay for, I guess.
